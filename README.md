### **Social Media Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning**

**Description:**
This project involves analyzing social media posts to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of users regarding specific topics or brands. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and build a model that accurately classifies sentiment.

**Features:**
- **Data Collection:** Gathered social media data using APIs (e.g., Twitter API) for a chosen topic or hashtag.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Implemented models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Visualization:** Sentiment trends are visualized over time with charts to show the public opinion dynamics.
- **Deployment:** Deployed as a Flask web app where users can input text or hashtags to get real-time sentiment analysis.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Python Programming
- Data Visualization
- Web Deployment

**Future Enhancements:**
- Expanding to multilingual sentiment analysis.
- Incorporating more advanced models like Transformers (e.g., BERT) for improved accuracy.
- Adding a dashboard for detailed analytics and sentiment trends.
